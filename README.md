## Capstone Project

This project-oriented course uses student teams to develop real-world Computer Information Systems (CIS) for actual customers. Students learn the importance of a systematic approach in the process of developing robust CIS, the management of projects, how to interact with customers and conduct requirements analysis, how to design/build/test systems, and the related technical and soft skills. Emphasis is placed on developing skills and knowledge in technical areas that have realistic value in the workplace. Depending on the nature of a project the technical skills can involve e-Commerce and Internet technologies, blockchain, client-server systems, mobile apps, machine learning, artificial intelligence, the Internet Of Things, Web interfaces to backend databases, relational databases, web design and interfaces, HTML, Java programming, scripting languages such as PHP for accessing databases through web interfaces. A key technical skill is the software systems design process with its various design activities, such as UML object modeling and prototyping, design patterns to reuse best practices, and various agile development practices. In addition to technical skills, students develop problem-solving, critical thinking, communication, and teamwork skills. By working on real-world systems with actual customers the students learn the appropriate skills – both technical and soft skills – for filling meaningful roles in the professional IT workplace.
